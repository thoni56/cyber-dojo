Extra information if you want to do some development.

The cyber-dojo server now lives inside a docker image called cyberdojofoundation/web
The script to build this image is
cyber-dojo/app/docker/web/build-image.sh

If you're running this image and you make a change to local source files the
changes will not be seen inside the server of course. You'll need to recreate
the web image, then bring down the old server and bring up the new one.
$ cd cyber-dojo/app/docker/web
$ ./build-image.sh
$ cd cyber-dojo/app/docker
$ ./cyber-dojo down
$ ./cyber-dojo up

You can run the tests from inside the running web server. First shell in
$ docker exec --interactive --tty cdf-web sh
Then run the tests
$ pwd
/usr/src/cyber-dojo
$ cd test
$ ./run.sh

This is a slow cycle. There is a faster one. Instead of running the cyber-dojo
rails app from inside the docker web image you can simply run it locally "raw".
$ cd cyber-dojo/script
$ ./dev-server.sh

You can also run the tests locally too. Note that the work to get the server running
inside a docker container *and* locally has left a few diagnostics that need attention.
$ cd cyber-dojo/test
$ ./run.sh
