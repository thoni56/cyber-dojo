exercises/cache.json
--------------------
Is automatically created by the app/models/exercises.rb constructor.

This is a simple cache of each exercise's
1. folder-name
2. instructions file content
This allows the create-page's choose-exercise to get all the information it needs
to display the exercises list and their instructions via a *single* disk access
of the cache.json file.
