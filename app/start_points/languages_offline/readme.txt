Approval style tests are currently off-line because their post-run
 .txt file retrieval is not trivial on a docker-machine/swarm solution
which is what we are currently working towards.

Once a docker-machine/swarm solution is in place we can investigate
how to re-instate Approval style tests, possibly by rsync'ing
changes back to the cyber-dojo server.
